 C++ Pay Slip Generation System

1.Description of the Project
The Pay Slip Generation System (PSG) is a menu-driven payroll application developed in C++ that automates the generation of pay slips for employees. The system supports both permanent and contractual employees and calculates their gross and net salaries based on various components such as DA (Dearness Allowance), HRA (House Rent Allowance), Professional Tax, Medical Allowance, PF (Provident Fund), and Income Tax.

The system provides options for the user to view salary details, adjust financial parameters (like tax or allowance values), and compute overtime dues. It simulates a real-world payroll process by maintaining employee data and generating structured pay slips interactively through a console-based interface.
